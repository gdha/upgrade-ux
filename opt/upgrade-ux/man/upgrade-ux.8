.SH "NAME"
upgrade-ux \- a framework to update or patch an Unix system (Linux, HP\-UX and Solaris)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBupgrade\-ux\fR [\fB\-dDsSpFvV\fR] [\fB\-c DIR\fR] \fICOMMAND\fR [\-\- \fIARGS\fR\&...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Upgrade\-ux is an Open Source upgrade framework to make patching and upgrades easy and repeatable\&.
.sp
Extending upgrade\-ux is made possible by its modular (ksh) framework\&. Consistent logging and optionally extended output help understand the concepts behind Upgrade\-ux and help debug during development\&.
.sp

.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.sp
There are several configuration files available under (\fB/etc/opt/upgrade\-ux/\fR):
.PP
\fBdefault\&.conf\fR
.RS 4
the default configuration file which defines parameters and variables\&. You should not change anything in here\&. If you need to modify a parameter then copy that line into the
\fBlocal\&.conf\fR
file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlocal\&.conf\fR
.RS 4
the local configuration file meant for the end\-user\&. Remember, configuration files should be treated as shell scripts\&.

.RS 4
parameters and settings only read by HP\-UX systems
.RE
.PP
\fBSunOS\&.conf\fR
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\fBexclude\&.packages\fR
.RS 4

.RE
.sp
You have the choice to create additional configuration files if required\&. Use the \fBupgrade\-ux dump\fR and check the \fIconfiguration tree\fR section to have a complete overview of all configuration files searched for (it is OK if these do not exist)\&.
.sp
A typical variable might be the YEAR setting to define from which year (instead of the default \fB$(date +%Y)\fR [current year]) we want to install the patch bundles\&.
.SH "INI FILES"
.sp
Each Unix Operating System requires an \fIINI\fR file which contains the sections the upgrade procedure will follow in sequence\&. The name of such \fIINI\fR file is build as follow:
.sp
\fB/etc/opt/upgrade\-ux/$OS\-$OS_VERSION\-$YEAR\&.ini\fR
.sp
The \fIINI\fR file is build out of sections (a section can be empty, except for the \fB[install]\fR INI section):
.PP
\fB[preremove]\fR
.RS 4
Add here any specific command to remove specific software bundles before starting the upgrade, e\&.g\&. if some software cannot be upgrade and should be re\-installed
.sp
.if n \{\

command[0] = (command)
options[0] = (options for above command)
bundle[0]  = (which software to remove)
version[0] = (specific version of above software bundle to be removed)

source[0]  = (location of the software depot)
bundle[0]  = (which software to install, update)

.fi

.RS 4
Directory containing all log files of each upgrade\-ux run with timestamps
.RE
.PP
/tmp/upgrade\-ux\&.xxx
.RS 4
Upgrade\-ux working directory\&. By default it is removed after each run\&. If upgrade\-ux exits with an error you probably need to remove this directory ny hand\&. In debugging mode the directory will not be removed as aid in helping to debug this software\&.
.RE
.PP
/opt/upgrade\-ux/scripts
.RS 4
Each section will have its own directory (with the name of a section) under this directory\&. Under each section directory you will find sub\-directories with $OS_VENDOR name\&. Finally, under the $OS_VENDOR directories you will find scripts (without the she\-bang!) that will be executed according the flow of the script\&. To honor the sequence use a prefix number\&. To see all scripts to be executed use the simulate option:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# /opt/upgrade\-ux/bin/upgrade\-ux \-s
upgrade\-ux 0\&.1 / Git
Using log file: /var/opt/upgrade\-ux/log/upgrade\-ux\-20140506\-1037\-hostname\&.log
