# 61_save_extend_filesystem_features.sh
# See https://github.com/gdha/upgrade-ux/issues/109
# Purpose: we had issues with an ext3 file system where suddently an ext4 feature got added and as a
# result it could not mount this ext3 file system. We had to mount it as an ext4 file system.
# Additional comment: reason was more then 32K directories on that mount point, and therefore, ext4 is forced
[[ ! -x /bin/findmnt ]] && return  # we need this command
[[ ! -x /bin/lsblk ]]   && return  # we need this command

[[ ! -f "$VAR_DIR/$DS/lsblk.before" ]] && lsblk -fipl > "$VAR_DIR/$DS/lsblk.before"

[[ ! -x /usr/sbin/dumpe2fs ]] && return # we need this to view the features of an extend file system

# What we want to is to join the output of e.g.
# dumpe2fs -h /dev/mapper/vg00-lv_log 2>/dev/null | grep "Filesystem features" | cut -d: -f2
#       has_journal ext_attr resize_inode dir_index filetype needs_recovery sparse_super large_file
# to a line of the output of findmnt where the file system type is extend (ext2, ext3 or ext4).
# Note: dumpe2fs needs 'root' privs
