# Only really valid for HP-UX 11.31 and update-ux process
# we will add a script in the pre-reboot area to add a marker in out status file so after a successful reboot
# we may skip the 'install' stage so we gain time:
# 1. no running update-ux again (as it is not required anymore)
# 2. avoid an error message by not re-running update-ux as it was already done (error message like:
# ERROR:   No software was selected for the following reasons:
#          - The same version of the following software is already installed (to
#            select this software, set '-x reinstall=true' and try again):
#            - HPUX11i-VSE-OE,r=B.11.31.1403
