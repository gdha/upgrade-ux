= Configuration

== Upgrade-ux related configuration files

The configuration files that +upgrade-ux+ uses are basically just shell scripts and should be treated as such.

The default location of the configuration files is +/etc/opt/upgrade-ux/+. However, if you are working with the sources (e.g. via git clone) then it is perfectly possible to use the relative paths, e.g.

    ls $HOME/project/upgrade-ux/etc/opt/upgrade-ux/

The easiest way to explain which configuration files are possible is by showing the output of the +upgrade-ux dump+ command:

=== Default configuration file default.conf
The +default.conf+ contains lots of variables which should not be changed by the end-user. If you wish to modify one just redefine it in the +local.conf+ file. 

A good example of such variable is the +YEAR+. In the +default.conf+ it is defined as:

    # The default year to use with our patch bundle is *current year* [ $(date '+%Y') ] - to overrule define it manually
    # in the local.conf file. E.g. when running upgrade-ux in 2015 but still installing patches from 2014 then define: YEAR=2014
    YEAR=$(date '+%Y')
    

However, in some cases as mentioned above, if you are in the year 2015 and you still want to install patch bundles of 2014 then it is necessary to define the +YEAR+ variable in the +local.conf+ file, as +YEAR=2014+ (or whatever, the year might be).

=== Local configuration file local.conf
The +local.conf+ should only contain variables which you want to overrule, as described in previous section (of the +default.conf+ file). It is important to know that the +local.conf+ file is the last configuration file read by +upgrade-ux+ script and therefore, the variables defined in there are the last ones that will be used.

=== Operating Specific configuration files

On each OS you have specific OS related configuration files, e.g.

    HP-UX.conf 
    GNU/Linux.conf
    SunOS.conf

These configuration files typically contain variables which have only a meaning within that specific OS, e.g. on HP-UX

    SWINSTALL=/usr/sbin/swinstall


== The INI files

The INI files are always OS specific and contain the definitions of which patch bundles should be installed or removed, and so on.
The INI files are kept under the +/etc/opt/upgrade-ux+ or +$HOME/project/upgrade-ux/etc/opt/upgrade-ux/+ directory and are typically called +$OS-$OS_VERSION-$YEAR.ini+

It follows also the different stages known within +upgrade-ux+ and these are best explained with an example INI file (below you see the INI file for HP-UX 11.11 systems):

=== The INI syntax
You can use as many comments as you like, but it should start with +#+ or +;+ sign.

A stage or section is started with +[section]+ header. The name within a section is known as a _stage_ within +upgrade-ux+.

A section may be empty or may contain arrays (some of those may be left out and will be treated as empty strings). An array will always be treated as a string by the way. The content of arrays are wiped out when you enter a new stage (or section) by +upgrade-ux+.

The following arrays are known to +upgrade-ux+:

 - command[] - add the command to be executed (it can be a variable name, e.g. +$SWINSTALL+)
 - options[] - add here specific options required by command[]
 - source[] - should be the source location where the software bundle reside
 - bundle[] - the name of the software bundle
 - version[] - the specific version to be installed/removed (can contain +*+ or may be empty as well)

If you do not need all arrays in a certain section then it is fine to leave these empty (or not mentioning these in the INI file)

Be careful although that you define the array index correctly in the INI file (see example above).

=== Section preremove
In the +preremove+ section you typically define lines of software bundles that should be removed for one of other reason, e.g. when upgrading these would be problematic (in the way the software was designed - read badly).
As said, if not needed leave this section empty.

=== Section preinstall
In the +preinstall+ section we could define some commands that need to be run, but in most case we write small scripts to do specific tasks in this stage (or section) such as stopping some daemons, saving evidence of software inventory and so on. More about thiese scripts in Chapter 6 (The Upgrade-ux scripts).

=== Section install
In the +install+ section you typically only define the software bundles that should be installed and in the right order. For example, for update the installation software (+update-ux+ or +yum+) before the new updates. In this stage we do not have much special scripts.

=== Section postinstall
In the +postinstall+ section we define the software pieces that were missing in the +install+ section for some specific reason (if any). Furthermore, in this stage we capture lots of evidence again and compare these via special scripts. Again see Chapter 6 (The Upgrade-ux scripts).

=== Section postremove
In the +postremove+ section you could remove software bundles taht were in the big update round of the +install+ section, but should not stay on this particular platform for some reason. Again, you may leave it empty if not needed.

=== Section configure
In the +configure+ section you could define scripts or commands to be executed by +upgrade-ux+ to configure or add something in cron.
See also the example shown above with +uncomment_cfg2html_in_crontab+, which is a toggle meant for a script called +/opt/upgrade-ux/scripts/configure/default/10_configure_commands.sh+ that simply touches a file under +$TMP_DIR+

Another way to had this defined would have been:

    command[0]="touch"
    options[0]="$TMP_DIR/uncomment_cfg2html_in_crontab"


=== Section cleanup
In the +cleanup+ section we could add commands to remove some old log files (of older software bundles), or you can also use it to report errors or any other message. The section is typically empty, but you could add some special scripts under +/opt/upgrade-ux/scripts/cleanup/default/+

=== Section postexecute
In the +postexecute+ section you could define commands and options of things you want to execute, e.g.

    command[0]      =       "/opt/cfg2html/bin/cfg2html"
    options[0]      =       "-2%Y%m%d"
