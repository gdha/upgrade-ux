= Basic Usage
Before digging deeper in +upgrade-ux+ lets explain the basic usage. The option help (+-h+) will produce the following:

[source,bash]
----
#-> /opt/upgrade-ux/bin/upgrade-ux -h
Usage: upgrade-ux [-dDFsSpvV] [-c DIR ] COMMAND [-- ARGS...]

 test            a simple test workflow
 upgrade         upgrade the operating system

Keep in mind that upgrade-ux has an excellent man page too. See +man 8 upgrade-ux+

It is important to know that +upgrade-ux+ is a quiet program and will not show any output if you do not request for it with the verbose option (+-v+). Another point of interest is its excellent logging facilities as under +/var/opt/upgrade-ux/log+ directory +upgrade-ux+ keep a log file of each run. The log files are composed as follow `upgrade-ux-<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMM>-LOGFILE.log`

We already mentioned the evidence files which are kept under +/var/opt/upgrade-ux/<YYYY-MM-DD>/+ directory. The type of files you find under there are of course different according the OS, OS version and which software is installed. Furthermore, _preview_ and _upgrade_ mode may result in more or less evidence files.

Starting up the program should be done by referencing the full path +/opt/upgrade-ux/bin/upgrade-ux+ as the directory is not part of the +PATH+ variable, and we prefer to keep it this way to avoid accidents.

You probably understood by now that +upgrade-ux+ must be started in _preview_ mode first before we can run it in _upgrade_ mode. However, we prefer that you always use the option +-p+ (_preview_ mode) to make it clear to yourself and other (when they need to dig into the log files for some reason) what you meant. Furthermore, in the log file there is always a trace of in which mode the program was running:

From the Chapter "Workflow" you probably remember that the default workflow is *upgrade* (even if you did not mention it). So, as example running +upgrade-ux+ in preview mode with verbose option is done as +/opt/upgrade-ux/bin/upgrade-ux -vp+

The last option that we bring to your attention in this Chapter is the force option (+-F+) which is handy in situation that for some reasons +upgrade-ux+ does not want to continue due to serious software (patches) problems. For example, within HP-UX we run the +check_patches+ command which when errors are detected will force an exit from +upgrade-ux+ so that the System Administrator can first fix these patches (or any other issue) before re-running +upgrade-ux+ again.
We have seen cases it was impossible to get everything fixed and for that reason you may use the force option, but please do not use it by default.
